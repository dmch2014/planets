Why is Pluto no longer a planet?
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of Pluto to that of a dwarf planet,
because it did not meet the three criteria the IAU uses to define a full-sized planet.
Essentially Pluto meets all the criteria except one- it “has not cleared its neighboring region of other objects.”
