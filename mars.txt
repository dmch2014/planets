Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun.
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
It seems now we are changing to Venus as base
Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide
and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.
